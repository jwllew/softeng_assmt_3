<!--This page will show an assessment's details, like the module it is assigned to, the lecturer, how many marks are up for grabs, how many marks the user has obtained, whether the assessment is formative or summative, etc. Lecturers will be able to see a list of all attempts, and what marks were given. There will be a link to the assessment creator, and a button that lets the user attempt the assessment, linking them to the correct attempt.html file-->
